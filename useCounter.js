/*
  I wrapped all the return functions in useCallback is because if the consumer of the hook is using React.memo in their component tree 
  AND if they pass one of the returning methods to the component that's wrapped in React.memo.
  I want to make sure I don't trigger a re-render of that component because they're trying to memoize it. If I don't wrap the function inside useCallback,
  then on every render the reference to that function will be new and even if the consumer is using React.Memo, it will trigger a re-render.
